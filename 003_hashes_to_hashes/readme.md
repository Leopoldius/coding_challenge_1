# Hashes to hashes

Write a hash table implementation in C where keys and values are both null terminated strings, with
functions to retrieve, insert and delete. Try to optimize for space.

# Remark by Leonid Z.

I have not been worked with hash table before. So, in real life I will choose to use open source implementation the algo. It will allow me to save time and to spend time on more important task, such as business logic implementation, board bring-up, firmware debugging, etc.

For that case I really like https://gist.github.com/phsym/4605704 implementation. The implementation needs to be ported onto certain embedded platform.
